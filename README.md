# SheCodes Basic Final Projects

This was originally made as my first repo on GitHub, to practice using git and the site.

It is a repository of the final projects I made for my SheCodes Basic course that I completed in February 2022.

As I’m learning to code, I’m going to continue to work on these projects – which are HTML and CSS based with tiny bits of JavaScript for now – and use this repo and these files as spaces for learning and experimentation. For now, my focus here will be on getting to grips with HTML, CSS and JavaScript specifically, while learning and implementing UI, UX and accessibility fundamentals.
